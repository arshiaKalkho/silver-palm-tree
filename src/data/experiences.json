        "explanation":"As part of a agile team, created a web application using NodeJS, grafana and influxDB to read information from modBus solar panel inverteds. the goal of the project was to read information from PLC placed inside Seneca Newnham Campus, the data was read using NodeJS and sent to influxDB, afterwards the data would be downloaded to grafana where we calculated expected output using a formula produced by Seneca's Engineering team which took into consideration weather, plant layout, inverter age and more. Also the software was able to predict inverter failure and reduce downtime. Our app was Sponsered by a third party company(Voltare Power)."
